		Cebu is known as the “Queen City of the South” because of its strategic and economic   importance to the country. It is one of the most prosperous cities in the country, and sees over 2 million foreign tourists annually. Cebu is the country's oldest city; it was the first Spanish settlement and the first capital of the Philippines. It officially became a city on April 27, 1594 through a Real provision by Philip II of Spain, preceding all other Philippine cities except Manila. The name "Cebu" came from the old Cebuano word sibu or sibo ("trade"), a shortened form of sinibuayng hingpit ("the place for trading"). It was originally applied to the harbors of the town of Sugbu, the ancient name for Cebu City. Why cebu is the best place? With a mountainous spine and abundant rainforest, Cebu is home to an incredible number of spectacular waterfalls. It's perfect for thrill-seekers too, the area is a popular spot for waterfall jumping, rapelling, rock climbing and canyoning. Tumalog Falls, near Oslob, is worth a visit too. There is no doubt why Cebu is considered as a top destination in the country because it offers every kind of attraction a tourist can ask for. From waterfalls, beaches, island hopping, heritage sites, festival, luxury resorts, and great food. These are only some of the reasons why you should love and visit Cebu.</p>
